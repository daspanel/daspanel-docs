# Linux Install

## Overview

You can use `Daspanel` with any modern Linux distribution. The only 
requirements are that you have installed `docker` and `docker-compose` on it. 
More information on how to install them can be found on these pages: 
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) and 
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Quick Start

### Create directory project

A Daspanel project can contain multiple sites that usually belong to a 
particular customer or that are related to each other. Let's assume that we are 
going to work with **customer1** sites:

``` shell
mkdir customer1
mkdir customer1/data
cd customer1
```

*The `customer1/data` directory will be used to store all the data and files 
of the sites managed by this project.*

### Download config files

``` shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daspanel/daspanel/master/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daspanel/daspanel/master/daspanel.env
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daspanel/daspanel/master/smtp.env
```

*Of course, you can use your browser to download the above files into the 
`customer1` directory*

### Configure email service

Probably the sites you host will need to send emails using the PHP command 
`mail()`. In addition, Daspanel will need to send you occasional notifications. 
To avoid SPAM issues Daspanel itself or sites hosted on it can't send emails 
directly. You need to set up an external mail sending service.

To do this, edit the `customer1/smtp.env` file and change the following settings:

| Setting    | Required | Example  | |
| :--------- | :------: | :------ | :------ |
| **DASPANEL_MAIL_SERVER**      | yes  | smtp.gmail.com:587 | SMTP server address in the format `host:port` |
| **DASPANEL_MAIL_USER** | yes  | user@gmail.com | Your login account in the SMTP server|
| **DASPANEL_MAIL_PWD** | yes  | verygoodpassword | Password of your SMTP account |
| **DASPANEL_MAIL_HUB** | yes  | gmail | Do not change for now |

!!! note
    The smtp.env file you downloaded is an example of how to set up sending emails using a Gmail account. Adapt it to your preferred email provider.
