# Site File Manager

Every hosting control panel needs a way to manage their files and minimally do some 
file operations like upload, download, delete, edit, etc. We choose not to use FTP but use a 
more modern way of doing this. The solution we chose is a tool that can be used 
through the browser.

To see the file manager of a site go to the <b><a href="http://admin.daspanel.site/sites/" target="_blank">Sites module</a></b>

[![Daspanel site](/img/site-control.png)](/img/site-control.png)

1. Click the **second bullet** to display the toolbox management area of the chosen site.

The site card will be changed to the toolbox management area:

1. Click on the file manager icon to access it.
