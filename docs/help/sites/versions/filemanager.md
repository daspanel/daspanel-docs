# Version File Manager

Every hosting control panel needs a way to manage their files and minimally do some 
file operations like upload, download, delete, edit, etc. We choose not to use FTP but use a 
more modern way of doing this. The solution we chose is a tool that can be used 
through the browser.

To see the available toolbox of a site go to the <b><a href="http://admin.daspanel.site/sites/" target="_blank">Sites module</a></b>

[![Daspanel site](/img/sites-versions.png)](/img/sites-versions.png)

1. Click the **third bullet** to display the versions management area of the chosen site.

The site card will be changed to the version management area:

[![Daspanel site versions tab](img/site-versions-area.png)](img/site-versions-area.png)

1. Click the **MANAGE** buttom to go the management page.

On the next page you will see a list of all the existing versions for the site:

1. Click on the **File manager** link which is in area **3** to access it.
